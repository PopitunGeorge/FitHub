            <h2>Workout Description</h2>
            <p>Whether it’s by choice or by factors outside of their control, some fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders have started training at home. Because of this, it could be considered more challenging to get a quality workout in. Some of the popular programs out there aren’t designed for home gym warriors.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, there is at least one program that takes this into consideration. Last month, M&S shared a training program called HIT3, which was created by former bodybuilder John Robert Cardillo. The high-intensity principles of that program, combined with the minimal rest periods, provide a challenge that many programs don’t.</p>
            <p>For those of you that can’t make it to the gym to try Cardillo’s HIT3 for yourself, don’t lose hope. You too can feel the benefits (and pain) of this program. This is the home gym version. These exercises can all be performed with basic equipment in a home gym setting.</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact, folks training in their own weight rooms could actually have an advantage over gym people. People training in gyms could be at the mercy of others using the desired equipment. People training at home have 100% control of their equipment. That means no waiting, no making quick changes, and you can plan the workout without any other outside factors.</p>
            <h2>Workout Schedule</h2>
            <p>A minimum of one day off after this workout is recommended, and two may be better. During that time, focus on eating quality food and getting plenty of rest. A sample schedule of this workout is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monday - Workout 1: Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps</li>
                <li>Tuesday - Rest</li>
                <li>Wednesday - Workout 2: Lower Back, Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, Calves</li>
                <li>Thursday - Rest</li>
                <li>Friday - Rest</li>
                <li>Saturday - Workout 3: Upper Back, Rear Delts, Traps, Biceps, Forearms, Abs</li>
                <li>Sunday - Rest</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="workout-details" class="workout-details">
            <h2>Workout 2: Lower Back, Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, Calves</h2>
            <p>These are a lot of exercises but remember you’re only doing one set of each. Since you only have one shot at them, make them meaningful and beneficial. Cardillo’s sequence here is designed with the intention of working the posterior chain as effectively as possible. That means starting at the top with the lower back and working down. He also placed hamstrings before quadriceps so the back of the thighs can grow in proportion with the front. Too many trainees place too much emphasis on the quads and throw in leg curls at the end. This prevents that.</p>

            <h2>Rest, Recovery, and Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Once the sessions are over, you’re going to very likely be sore. However, many people will try to push through and train again. Don’t do this. As admirable as it may be to carry on, the rest is actually a part of the muscle-building game here. That time to recover is crucial. Recovery tactics such as stretching and massaging should be used when possible. Getting proper sleep is essential as well.</p>
            <p>Finally, focus as hard on what you’re eating as you do on how you’re training. Drink plenty of water every day (most people should focus on having a gallon), and keep that menu high in protein to support those muscle-building efforts. Whichever nutrition program you are following likely has its own guidelines around carbs and fats, but make sure the protein is there. Many people can benefit from having one gram per pound of bodyweight.</p>
