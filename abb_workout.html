            <h2>Workout Description</h2>
            <p>Let’s face it; having to read about another ab workout program is like trying to get excited about going to the dentist. Both sometimes seem to be more of a chore than anything remotely fun.</p>
            <p>And to make matters even worse, performing and maintaining a genuine abs routine is like buying new tires; not something you really like to spend your time or money on but you know deep down they will improve performance.</p>
            <p>A necessary evil? Yes, but let’s change that!</p>
            <p>Sure, diet is paramount when it comes to developing great abs for all to see, but you mustn’t forgo a solid and effective ab program to reap the maximum benefits from your efforts.</p>
            <p>It’s time to stop throwing in a few sets of crunches at the end of a workout with empty hopes that one day your eight pack will suddenly reveal itself through pitiful focus.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Abdominal and Core Training</h3>
            <p>A solid core can be a key factor regarding strength providing improved balance and shoring up weak midsection stability during big lifts. Because of this, you should adhere to a sound and effective plan of attack to boost gains for not only vanity reasons but also increase performance residually through other lifts.</p>
            <p>In short, a stronger core equals stronger squats, deadlifts and bench presses. Everything (power, strength, stability) is first derived from our core.</p>
            <p>If this area gets its due attention we have no choice but to reap reward in its execution. A tight, strong midsection creates whole-body strength and who would pass that up?</p>

            <h3>Understanding the Core Musculature</h3>
            <p>The muscles of the abdominals comprise of several areas that flex, extend, twist and stabilize the trunk area. They sit on the front sides of the lower torso originating along the ribcage and attaching along the pelvis. Below is a quick look at each muscle and its function.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rectus Abdominus:</strong> This is the coveted “six-pack” muscle – although it has more than six heads. This muscle flexes the spine and brings the ribcage and pelvis closer together.</li>
                <li><strong>Transverse Abdominus:</strong> This muscle is a deep muscle of the core which lies beneath the other muscles that is essential for trunk stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal and External Obliques:</strong> These are diagonal muscles that work to rotate the torso and stabilize the abdomen.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>10 Effective Abdominal Exercises</h3>
            <p>Below are ten key moves and their modifications to help you crunch, squeeze and pound your abs into tempered steel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leg Raises:</strong> Leg raises can be performed on a flat bench, a decline bench or hanging. For the hanging version, begin with a straight leg and then as you tire, bend your knees to keep the set going for an intense burn.</li>
                <li><strong>Bicycles:</strong> You can perform bicycles the traditional way by alternating sides or make it a bit more challenging by isolating one side and then switching over to the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Planks:</strong> Once you reach a level of several sets of 30 seconds with the traditional plank it is time for a new challenge. Have a partner place a weight plate on your upper back to add resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Dragon Flags:</strong> For the more advanced out there, try performing the dragon flag on a decline bench.</li>
                <li><strong>Windshield Wipers:</strong> Perform the movement as you would normally, but now place a small weighted medicine ball between your feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Planks:</strong> Try switching from a side plank to a normal plank over to another side plank slowly.</li>
                <li><strong>Russian Twists:</strong> If you find using a medicine ball or weight plate difficult, simply clasp your hands in front of you and perform the exercise as usual.</li>
                <li><strong>Crunches:</strong> The many forms of the crunch include performing them on a flex-ball, feet supported on a bench, and weighted by holding a small weight plate on your chest.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Crunches:</strong> In addition to performing traditional side crunches on a sit-up bench or on the floor, side crunches can also be performed on a Roman chair.</li>
                <li><strong>Sit-Ups:</strong> Sit-ups can be modified using a decline bench and holding a weight plate on your chest with crossed arms.</li>
            </ul>
